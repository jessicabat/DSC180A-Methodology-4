### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
I found the agent Causal Copilot very interesting overall. It takes in a csv file from the user
and generates a report containing visualizations of descriptive statistics, inferred causal
structures, treatment effects, and accompanying natural language explanations of the data the user provided.

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
We would like to create an expanded version of the Causal Copilot. I was thinking maybe using the large knowledge
graph we created at the end of this quarter as background knowledge, the causal copilot could take a tabular data
from the same domain and infer more stable and clear causal relationships for the user.

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
We'd have to think and experiment a lot to integrate the separate frameworks to perform tasks as one. It could be
quite different from when we focus on one tool or framework separately.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I’d like to explore prompt engineering and topic modeling methods to improve how text data is transformed into knowledge graphs.
